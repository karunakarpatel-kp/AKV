## <a name='WhatisReact.js'></a>What is React.js?

[React.js](https://react.dev/learn), commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. React.js was developed by Facebook, which allows developers to create reusable UI components that can efficiently update when data changes. The main feature of React.js is its **virtual DOM** (Document Object Model) which enables high performance by minimizing the need for direct manipulation of the DOM.

## <a name='WhatisNext.js'></a>What is Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), on the other hand, is a React Full stack framework for building **server-side rendered (SSR)** and statically generated web applications. It provides an efficient development experience by offering features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and efficient routing out of the box. Next.js is known for its ability to improve performance and SEO while making things easier in the development process.

## <a name='Next.jsvsReact.js:UnderstandingtheDifferences'></a>Next.js vs React.js: Understanding the Differences

### <a name='Performance'></a>Performance

**Next.js** excels in performance due to its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities. By pre-rendering pages on the server side and serving them as **static assets**, Next.js reduces the time-to-interactivity and improves load times, resulting in a smoother user experience. React, on the other hand, relies on client-side rendering by default, which can lead to slower initial page loads, especially for content-rich applications.

### <a name='ServerSideRendering'></a>Server Side Rendering

One of the key advantages of Next.js is its built-in support for **server-side rendering (SSR)**, which allows pages to be generated on the server and sent to the client as fully rendered HTML. This not only improves performance but also enhances [SEO](https://www.karunakarpatel.com/Blog/nextjs_seo) by ensuring that search engine crawlers can index the content accurately. While React can achieve SSR through additional configurations or third-party libraries, Next.js simplifies the process with its integrated SSR support.

### <a name='Staticsitegeneration'></a>Static site generation

Next.js goes a step further by offering [static site generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#static-site-generation-getstaticprops), where pages are pre-built at build time and served as static files. This approach is ideal for content-driven websites or blogs that don't require real-time data updates. React, being a client-side library, does not natively support SSG, although it can be implemented with tools like Gatsby.js or **Next.js**.

### <a name='Routing'></a>Routing

[**Routing**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) is another area where Next.js shines, providing simple and intuitive routing out of the box. With Next.js, developers can define routes directly within the project structure, making it easy to create dynamic and nested routes. React, while capable of handling routing with libraries like **React Router**, requires additional setup and configuration for complex routing scenarios.
