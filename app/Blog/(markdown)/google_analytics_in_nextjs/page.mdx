## <a name='Step1:CreateaGoogleAnalyticsAccount'></a>Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account

If you don't already have a **Google Analytics account**, you'll need to create one by visiting the [Google Analytics website](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) and signing up for an account. Once you've created an account, you'll be prompted to set up a new property for your website.

## <a name='Step2:ObtaintheTrackingID'></a>Step 2: Obtain the Tracking ID

After creating a property for your website, you'll be provided with a **tracking ID**. This tracking ID is a unique identifier that you'll need to **integrate Google Analytics with your Next.js application**. Copy the tracking ID for later use.

## <a name='Step3:InstalltheGoogleAnalyticsPackage'></a>Step 3: Install the Google Analytics Package

Next, you'll need to install the `` `react-ga` `` package, which is a JavaScript library for integrating Google Analytics with React applications. You can install the package using npm or yarn:

```
npm install react-ga
```

```
yarn add react-ga
```

## <a name='Step4:InitializeGoogleAnalytics'></a>Step 4: Initialize Google Analytics

In your Next.js application, create a new file named `` `analytics.js` `` (or any other name you prefer) in the `` `utils` `` directory. In this file, initialize Google Analytics with your tracking ID:

```

// utils/analytics.js
import ReactGA from 'react-ga';
export const initGA = () => {
  ReactGA.initialize('YOUR_TRACKING_ID');
};

export const logPageView = () => {
  ReactGA.set({ page: window.location.pathname });
  ReactGA.pageview(window.location.pathname);
};

```

## <a name='Step5:IntegrateGoogleAnalyticswithNext.js'></a>Step 5: Integrate Google Analytics with Next.js

Next, you'll need to **integrate Google Analytics** with your Next.js application by using the `` `useEffect` `` hook to initialize Google Analytics when the component mounts and track page views:

```

// pages/_app.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { initGA, logPageView } from '../utils/analytics';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!window.GA_INITIALIZED) {
      initGA();
      window.GA_INITIALIZED = true;
    }
    logPageView();
    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', logPageView);
  }, []);

  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;

```
